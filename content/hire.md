## What I bring to the table

I have a career as a software developer which spans over 20 years. I have spent a lot of this time working as Team Lead on small teams or as the sole programmer building new applications from the ground up in industries such as Finance, Insurance, Human Resouces, Warehousing and more. 

I can take software projects _from conception to final delivery_ and _communicate frequently and clearly_ with clients to ensure they are at all times aware of the status of the project. At all times I am _honest with clients about my abilities_, and my 20+ years of experience allow me to make decisions which are in the best interest of the project.

I am comfortable working across the entire stack for web applications, though my strength is in the back-end. I am also familiar with developing command-line and serverless applications.

I have vast experience working with authentication and authorization, as I have been responsible for the development and maintenance of all the .NET SDKs, sample applications and tutorials for [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) over the past 2+ years. I have also been involved in various other open source projects related to OAuth 2.0.

I blog on this website about .NET related topics and also curate [ASP.NET Weekly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/aspnetweekly/), which is a weekly digest of all the best ASP.NET related news and blog posts. 

Currently, I am the primary contributor and maintainer of [various open source utilities](/tools). 

## Work I am interested in

I am interested in either freelance work or permanent remote positions requiring C#, .NET Core or ASP.NET Core skills - either as part of an existing team or working solo on a stand-alone project or proof-of-concept.

## Technologies I work with

The following are some of my primary technologies I am familiar with:

* ASP.NET Core (MVC, Razor Pages and APIs)
* HTML, JavaScript and CSS
* Angular
* OpenID Connect
* JSON Web Tokens
* Serverless (AWS Lambda and Azure Functions)
* Auth0
* Command-line applications
