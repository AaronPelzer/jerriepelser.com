## A bit about me

I have been using C# and .NET since the first beta versions came out in 2000, and my current focus is mostly around .NET Core and ASP.NET Core.

Currently, I am the primary contributor to [various open source utilities](/tools), and I am responsible for maintaining all the .NET related SDKs and sample applications for [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).

I blog on this website about .NET related topics and also curate [ASP.NET Weekly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/aspnetweekly/), which is a weekly digest of all the best ASP.NET related news and blog posts.

## Work I am interested in

I am interested in either freelance work or permanent remote positions requiring .NET Core or ASP.NET Core skills.

## My skills

The following are some of my primary technologies I am familiar with:

* ASP.NET Core (MVC, Razor Pages and APIs)
* HTML, JavaScript and CSS
* Angular
* OpenID Connect
* JSON Web Tokens
* Serverless (AWS Lambda and Azure Functions)
* Auth0

You can also view [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jerriep/) to get an idea of the sort of work I do.
