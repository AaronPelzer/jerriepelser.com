I publish a weekly newsletter for ASP.NET Developers called [ASP.NET Weekly](http://www.aspnetweekly.com) which contains a curated list of the best ASP.NET related content I came across during the previous week. 

Each week I feature a tool or library which I think ASP.NET developers will find useful. This is part 4 in a 5 part series of blog posts during which I recap all the tools and libraries I featured during the past year.

I re-publish these with the exact descriptions I used in the newsletter, so see my commentary in that context...

## 31. [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/)

If you are a lover of all things Material Design, you will be happy to know that you can now apply some of that Material Design love to your website. Google has released the Material Design Lite CSS framework which allows you to apply Material Design styles and principles to your website. 

## 32. [ExpressMapper](http://www.expressmapper.org/)

AutoMapper has long been one of my go-to libraries which I use in most projects. Well it seems that there is now a new kid on the block which wants to upset the status quo. The ExpressMapper API seems fairly similar to AutoMapper so it should be familiar for developers which currently use AutoMapper. 

It does however claim [massive performance gains](http://www.expressmapper.org/#benchmarks) over AutoMapper and other similar libraries. If you're an existing AutoMapper user then it may be worth your while to check it out.

## 33. [Visual Studio Web Development Extensions](http://webtooling.visualstudio.com/extensions/web-development/)

This week's tool is not a single tool, but I am rather pointing you to this web page which lists a whole bunch of Visual Studio extensions that assists with web development.

There are 15+ extensions listed, so go through them. You are bound to find at least one which you will find handy.

## 34. [WebApiThrottle](https://github.com/stefanprodan/WebApiThrottle)

WebApiThrottle is an ASP.&#8203;NET Web API rate limiter for IIS and OWIN hosting. It is designed to control the rate of requests that clients can make to a Web API based on IP address, client API key and request route.

## 35. [Designing for Performance](http://designingforperformance.com/)

This week's tool is actually a book. Lara Callender Hogan has graciously made available for free her book entitled "Designing for Performance". The book helps you approach your web development projects with page speed in mind, showing you how to test and benchmark which design choices are most critical. 

You can read it free on the web, or show your gratitude to her by buying the print or ebook versions.

## 36. [Bootbox.js](http://bootboxjs.com/)

Bootbox.js is a small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Bootstrap modals, without having to worry about creating, managing or removing any of the required DOM elements or JS event handlers.

## 37. [Bootstrap Starter Kit](http://bootstrapstarterkit.com/)

I prefer not showcasing commercial products in this section, but I feel I need to make an exception with this one. You can think of Bootstrap Starter Kit as an HTML theme on steroids. It allows you to very rapidly build website by dragging and dropping predefined building blocks on a design surface.

Check out [the live demo](http://www.bootstrapstarterkit.com/bskit-demo/) to get an idea of how you can rapidly build a website.

## 38. [Tag-it](https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it)

Tag-it is a A jQuery UI plugin to handle multi-tag fields as well as tag suggestions/autocomplete. If you need to give your users the ability to enter multiple tags, then this is a good option for you to look at. 

## 39. [Bootstrap Tour](http://bootstraptour.com/)

Bootstrap Tour is an open source library that allows you to easily add a product tour to your application by using Bootstrap popovers.

## 40. [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly)

Shouldly is a .NET library which allows you to write much better assertions for your unit test. It goes beyond just the ease of use of assertions as it give great failure messages that allow developers to track down why a test failed mush more easily. For more examples on how to use if you can also [check out the documentation](http://docs.shouldly-lib.net/v2.4.0/docs).
