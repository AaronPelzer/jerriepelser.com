  Time to leave my job at Auth0 and explore some new opportunities.

It is time for new adventures.

Over the past months, I have started feeling what seemed at the time like an unhappiness with my work. After reflecting on this for a while, I have realised that there was nothing inherent about the work at Auth0 which made me unhappy. 

It is a great company with great people, and the work is, for the most part, satisfying and challenging. Instead, I realised that I felt unhappy and frustrated because I am, in a sense, working on the wrong stuff. 

I have so many ideas for projects that I want to work on, but between my job and other life commitments and just never get around to doing it.

I have made some starts on side-projects, and I always run out of energy over the long term to pursue that alongside everything else.

I decided the right thing to do was to give it a proper go and spend my time primarily on my own projects. 

**So I resigned.**

_I have however since come to an arrangement where I will still help Auth0 out on their .NET SDKs and Quickstarts for a limited number of hours every month_

**What sort of projects will I be working on?**

Many things...

Every time I come across something that makes me think "that sucks, why isn't there an app for that?", I write it down on a list.

Sometimes I come across other things that make me think "wouldn't it be cool if there was software that did this?". I write that down on the same list.

So my "That sucks / Wouldn't it be cool" list has grown quite long and is ever expanding. 

Besides the apps, I think I also have a book (or two) I want to write.

I am going to try and tackle as many of these as I can over the coming year or so. 

I have no grand schemes for building a multi-million dollar startup or anything like that. If one of these projects can turn into a sustainable business which supports me financially, that would be great.

For me, it is about experimentation and learning. Experiment with a new idea. Build it. Ship it. Learn from it. Then rinse and repeat.

And it is also about having fun again, by losing myself in projects which truly interests me.
