Just a quick note that I will be (sort of) taking a break from blogging for the rest of December and perhaps part of January as well.

Right now I am a bit swamped with paying work, and it is an effort for me to come up with, and write a new blog post every week. I also have a little side-project going which excites me a lot, so I want to spend my free time on that for the next couple of months. 

I have been blogging consistently every week for most of this year, so it is time to take a breather. The blog has grown very nicely this year, and traffic is more than double what it was for the same period last year - this despite the fact that I split off a lot of content to the [OAuth for ASP.NET](http://www.oauthforaspnet.com/) website in January.

I also want to take some time to think about how I want to approach the next year in terms of the content I produce, and come up with something sustainable. I started with the [AspnetCasts](http://www.aspnetcasts.com/) channel on YouTube and have done a few videos, but it has stagnated recently. I want to think about merging a lot of the content I do on YouTube as well as the blog posts.

So while I will not producing any new content, what I am going to do is a series of blog posts highlighting all the tools and libraries I featured in [ASP.NET Weekly newsletter](http://www.aspnetweekly.com/) over the year, and perhaps some of the other most popular posts. This will not take too much effort from me, and still hopefully gives you valuable content. 

The [ASP.NET Weekly newsletter](http://www.aspnetweekly.com/) will carry one as usual until 15 December when I will take a break from it and resume it again in January.

I am leaving Southeast Asia after 3 years and heading back to South Africa on 19 December. I will stay there until late in January when I will head over the the USA for about a week and then head south either to Mexico or somewhere in Central- or South America. 

Hope you all have a great holiday, and for fellow Christians **I hope you have a wonderful, blessed Christmas**!

Speak to you all again next year.
