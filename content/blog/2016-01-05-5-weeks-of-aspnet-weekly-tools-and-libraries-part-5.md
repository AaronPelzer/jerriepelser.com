I publish a weekly newsletter for ASP.NET Developers called [ASP.NET Weekly](http://www.aspnetweekly.com) which contains a curated list of the best ASP.NET related content I came across during the previous week. 

Each week I feature a tool or library which I think ASP.NET developers will find useful. This is part 5 in a 5 part series of blog posts during which I recap all the tools and libraries I featured during the past year.

I re-publish these with the exact descriptions I used in the newsletter, so see my commentary in that context...

## 49. [Node School](http://nodeschool.io/)

Yeah, this is an ASP.&#8203;NET newsletter, but I also strongly believe that programmers should be proficient in multiple programming languages. Having good JavaScript skills is especially useful for any sort of web developer. 

A few months ago I attended a Node School which was organised in the city I lived in an really enjoyed the experience. Have a look at the Node School website. They have plenty of details on upcoming workshops all over the world, and well as details on how to host your own workshop. 

Even if you decide not to attend (or host) a Node School, you can still work through the lessons on your own time at home.

Cerberus is a set of responsive email patterns which you can use in your applications and help you ease some of the pain of creating email templates.

## 53. [You Don't Need jQuery](https://github.com/oneuijs/You-Dont-Need-jQuery)
