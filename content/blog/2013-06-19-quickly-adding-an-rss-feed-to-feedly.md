I have made peace with Google dropping support for Google Reader and it seems as though I have settled on [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com/) as my Google Reader replacement (although I would like to see what the guys from Digg [come up with](http://www.digg.com/reader) as well).  One of the Google Chrome extensions which have come in quite handy over the years is the [RSS Subscription Extension (By Google)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd).  When you visit a website which publishes RSS feeds, this extension would add a small icon to the Chrome address bar which you can click on to quickly add the RSS Feed to Google Reader.

Of course this will soon be of no use to me any more once Google Reader is retired, but I would have liked to have the same functionality to quickly add a feed to Feedly.  A quick search on the web brought me to [this page](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/04/10/adding-new-feeds-to-your-feedly/) on which it was discussed how to use this same extension to add a feed to Feedly instead.

**Just a quick note before we continue.** You can always click on the semi-transparent Feedly icon in the bottom right of a web page which publishes an RSS feed to subscribe to that particular feed in Feedly, as described in Case #5 of the Feedly website referred to above.  The only drawback to using this is that when the website publishes multiple feeds if does not give you an option to specify which feed you want to subscribe to which is why I prefer to make use of the RSS Subscription extension.

## Step-by-step guide of installing and using the extension

If you are not already using the extension you can add it by going to the following URL ([https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd)) and Click on the "Add to Chrome" button.

Once it is installed go to the list of  Chrome extensions by typing [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in your Chrome address bar and hitting Enter.  Scroll down to the "RSS Subscription Extension (by Google)" extension and click on Options.

You will see the Options page for the extension with a list of feed readers that you can add feeds to.  Click on the Add button.  In the Description field type in "Feedly" and in the URL field type in "http://www.feedly.com/home#subscription/feed/%s" (without the quotes).  Next click on Save.  You should now see Feedly in the list.  Ensure that it is the default option.

If you are only ever going to use Feedly you can tick the "Always use my default reader when subscribing to feeds." option.

Now when you navigate to a website containing RSS feeds you will notice an RSS icon to the right of the address bar.  Clicking on the icon gives you a list of feeds you can subscribe to

Clicking on the link for the feed you want to subscribe to will display the feed in Feedly.  Click on  "+add to my feedly".

This will present you with a final screen confirming the title of the feed as well as allowing you to assign the feed to a category.  Update any information you would like to change and click Add.

I hope this will help you making the process of adding feeds to Feedly a little bit more easy.
