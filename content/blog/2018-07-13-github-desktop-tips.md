I have been using GitHub Desktop more frequently recently, and in the process, I have stumbled across various things which helps you navigate around the user interface faster.

## 1. Launch from the command-line

You can launch GitHub Desktop from the command-line by running this `github` command. What is especially useful about this is that if you are inside a directory containing a GitHub repository, GitHub Desktop will automatically navigate to this repository.

    />

## 2. Navigate to repository

To quickly navigate to a different repository, use `Ctrl+T` (on Windows) or `Cmd+T` (on a Mac) to open the repository list. You can then start typing the name of the repository to filter the list of repositories by that name quickly. Highlight the repository you want and press the `Enter` / `Return` key to open that repository. This is especially useful if, like me, you are working across many different repositories.

    />

## 3. Navigate to a branch

Want to quickly switch to that feature branch you want to work on? Use `Ctrl+B` / `Cmd+B` to open the branch list and start typing the name of the branch to filter the list of branches quickly. Highlight the branch you want and press the `Enter` / `Return` key to switch to the branch.

    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Switch to existing branch"
    />

## 4. Create a new branch

Want to create a new branch for a feature you are working on? Use `Ctrl+Shift+N` / `Cmd+Shift+N` to open the **Create a Branch** dialog.

    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Create a new branch"
    />

## 5. Open the repository directory in File Explorer / Finder

Often when working with a repository, you may want to open the directory containing the repository in File Explorer / Finder to view and operate on the files. You can do this by using the `Ctrl+Shift+F` / `Cmd+Shift+F` keyboard shortcut.

    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Open in File Explorer"
    />

## 6. Open the repository on GitHub.com

You may also want to open the repository on the GitHub website. Use the `Ctrl+Shift+G` / `Cmd+Shift+G` shortcut to open the repository on github.com inside your web browser.

    src="/images/blog/2018-07-13-github-desktop-tips/open-in-github.png"
    data-gif="/images/blog/2018-07-13-github-desktop-tips/open-in-github.gif"
    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Open in GitHub"
    />

## 7. Open repository on command-line

How about opening the directory containing the repository on the command line so you can run git commands directly from the command-line? Use the ``Ctrl+` `` shortcut.

<img class="gifplayer" 
    src="/images/blog/2018-07-13-github-desktop-tips/open-in-command-line.png"
    data-gif="/images/blog/2018-07-13-github-desktop-tips/open-in-command-line.gif"
    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Open in command-line"
    />

Bonus points for this being the same shortcut used to open the Terminal window in Visual Studio Code, so muscle memory kicks in. You can change the Default Shell in the GitHub Desktop Options (using `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`).

## 8. Open repository in your editor

Want to start coding? Use the `Ctrl+Shift+A`/`Cmd+Shift+A` shortcut to open the directory inside your favourite code editor.

    src="/images/blog/2018-07-13-github-desktop-tips/open-in-editor.png"

    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Open in editor"
    />

You can change the Default Code Editor in the GitHub Desktop Options (using `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`).

## 9. Go over to the dark side

Is dark mode your thing? Good news is that **since version 1.2.4**, you can switch between Light and Dark themes. Open the Options/Preferences using `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,` and navigate to the _Appearance_ tab.

    style="width: 100%;"
    alt="Switch to dark mode"
    />
