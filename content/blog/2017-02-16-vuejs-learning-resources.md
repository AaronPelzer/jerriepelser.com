Vue does not get nearly the amount of attention that Angular or React does, but it still has a flourishing community and plentiful resources are available for learning Vue. It has also [had amazing growth in 2016](https://medium.com/the-vue-point/vue-in-2016-8df71d98bfb3#.k54yhfyl8).

In this blog post I will take a look at some of the resources I have found so fair for aiding me in learning Vue.

I will be updating this blog post as I come across new resources of note.

## The Official Website

The official [Vue.js website](https://vuejs.org/) is outstanding, and if that was the only resource available to you, you would probably be fine.

### The Guide

The [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) will walk you through all the concepts related to Vue. It starts with installing Vue and then goes on to a basic introduction and covering all of the core concepts such as the Vue Instance, the Template Syntax, Components, etc.

It also covers a wide range of advanced concepts such as transitions, mixins, plugins, etc.

### API Documentation

The [Vue API documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/) looks to be very complete and contains information on all the Vue API, directives and built-in components.

By itself probably not a good resource to get started, but once you get going it is a good place to get more information on how to use various aspects of the API.

### Examples

The [Examples section](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/) of the website contains various embedded JSFiddles that demonstrates various aspects of Vue. It seems like a good place to learn about some of the aspects in isolation.

## Videos and Courses

There is a wide range of free videos available on **YouTube**. Two that stand out is:

* [Vue.js 2.0 In 60 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6hQqgvGI4Y). This is a quick introduction to Vue by Brad Traversy.
* [Vue.js Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzSjlLzGB1A&list=PLwAKR305CRO_1yAao-8aZiQnBqJeyng4O) is a series of videos by J. Alexander Curtis that also walks you through a basic introduction to Vue.

If you're an **[Egghead](https://egghead.io)** fan (like me), they have a short video course available called [Develop Web Apps with Vue.js](https://egghead.io/courses/develop-web-apps-with-vue-js).

You can also look at the [Vue section](https://egghead.io/technologies/vue) of their website for more videos. I have also noticed that there are 2 upcoming courses called **Build a Vue.js app with Vuex** and **Build a Server Rendered Vue.js App with Nuxt and Vuex**.

The last one I want to mention - and the route I went - is a Udemy course called [
Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vuex)](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). It is a paid course (I got it at a discount for $15). 

I decided on going with this as I liked the style of the instructor (from what I have seen on the preview videos). I also liked the project based approach he is taking to the course.

## Other resources

There are many other resource available for learning Vue. One I would highly recommend you bookmark (or star) is [Awesome Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue).

This contains a rich set of resources related to Vue. From official documentation, podcasts, examples and tutorials to get you started, to list of libraries, editors and other resources to smooth your development.

## Conclusion

This is by no means an exhaustive list of Vue resources (for that see [Awesome Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue)), but it is good enough to get you going.
