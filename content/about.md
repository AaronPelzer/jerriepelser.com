  Information about me and this blog
---

My name is Jerrie Pelser. I am a **South African** software developer with 20+ years professional development experience, currently living in **Bangkok, Thailand**. This is my personal blog where I write mostly about technical software development issues - though I may throw in some random thoughts from time to time.

I have been using **C#** and **.NET** since the first beta versions came out in 2000. Before that I also worked with **Delphi**, **Visual Basic** and **Clipper**.

I am working as a freelance software developer with a small number of select clients, leaving me enough time to work on my own projects, blog and learning new technologies.

I also curate [ASP.NET Weekly](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/aspnetweekly), which is a weekly digest of all the best ASP.NET related news and blog posts.
